## Security Best Practices

When using DictionaryCoder:

1. **Validate Input**: Always validate dictionary data from untrusted sources
2. **Handle Errors**: Properly handle decoding errors to avoid exposing sensitive information
3. **Type Safety**: Use specific types rather than `Any` where possible
4. **Access Control**: Be cautious about what data you decode from external sources
5. **Dependencies**: Keep your Swift version and dependencies up to date

## Known Security Considerations

### Dictionary Sources

DictionaryCoder decodes data from dictionaries. Always be cautious when:
- Decoding data from untrusted sources
- Decoding data that could contain malicious values
- Exposing error messages to end users (they may contain sensitive information)

### Type Coercion

DictionaryCoder performs type coercion (e.g., converting doubles to integers). Be aware:
- Numeric conversions may truncate values
- Large numbers may overflow when converting to smaller types
- The library detects overflows and throws errors, but validate inputs when possible

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1)
- Announced in GitHub Security Advisories
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Tagged with appropriate CVE identifiers when applicable

## Contact

For security concerns, contact:
- **Email**: dale@myers.io
